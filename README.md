In designing software, I approach it with a balance of curiosity and methodical planning. My work on the project has honed my design skills by teaching me how to create visually cohesive representations while striving for authenticity. Throughout the project, I followed a design process that involved meticulous attention to detail, especially when it came to accurately representing real-world objects in a virtual environment. The tactics from my design approach can be applied in future work by maintaining a focus on precision and authenticity while also allowing room for creativity and experimentation.

When it comes to developing programs, I approach it with a combination of research, planning, and hands-on experimentation. Working on my 3D scene, I employed new development strategies such as modularizing code and using object-oriented principles to enhance organization and maintainability. Iteration played a significant role in my development process, allowing me to refine and improve my code as I progressed through the project milestones. My approach to developing code has evolved throughout the milestones, leading me to prioritize readability, efficiency, and scalability to ensure the project's completion.

Computer science offers valuable tools and knowledge that can help me reach my goals by providing a solid foundation in problem-solving, critical thinking, and technical skills. Computational graphics and visualizations have equipped me with new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future educational pathway by expanding my understanding of computer graphics principles and OpenGL programming. In my future professional pathway, these skills can be applied to pursue opportunities in graphics-related fields such as game development, animation, virtual reality, and more, where the demand for skilled practitioners continues to grow.
